As you can see - I am not arming the ESC here.
For some reason, the ESC is now on a persistently armed mode now.
Upon powering, the ESC automatically arms.
Given sparse documentation for the ESC, I am not examining this behavior change.

However, if your ESC refuses to arm, see the first post in this thread.
